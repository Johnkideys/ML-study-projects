During this project work I created various Machine Learning models to predict the air quality based on the dataset above. 

Abstract of my findings:  
In this assignment study, the application of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost, was studied for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Indian cities. Notably, the study did not find significant differences between these models, contrary to previous research. This study highlights the need for addressing overfitting in tree-based models through careful hyperparameter tuning and alternative feature selection methods. The practical applications of AQI prediction, including decision making for policymakers, identifying pollution sources, and population health management, are emphasized.
Considering the limitations of the study, the future work is suggested to make use of additional models like neural networks or K-nearest neighbours, implement stratified K-fold cross-validation to address class imbalance, and using techniques such as Grid Search or Bayesian Search for hyperparameter tuning.
